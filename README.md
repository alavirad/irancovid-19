# irancovid-19
This repository includes daily data and model predictions for the spread of COVID-19 in Iran. We push daily updates here consisting of daily reports sourced from the IR Ministry of Health and Medical Education along with our model outcomes for the last 7 days and predictions for the next 500 days.

The updates are uploaded daily as a new csv file with consistent filename dd/mm/yyyy. Each csv file includes 10 columns with self-descriptive column names: date, infected, daily_infected, recovered, death, active_infected, predicted_active_infected, predicted_total_recovered, predicted_total_death, predicted_total_infected

DISCLAIMER: We are not epidemiologists. We are simply scientists and engineers interested in networks, data and the spreading phenomena. We are not connected or supported by any government organizations in Iran or abroad. Results reported here are not peer-reviewed by other scientists. COVID-19 data from Iran may be significantly under-reported and thus, the actual number of infected cases and deaths may be different. Predictions are simply based on a classical and widely used mathematical model and may carry high level of uncertainty. Therefore, the predictions should be carefully used as means to inform policy making and planning.

In no event, shall we or our employers (University of New South Wales and Monash University), be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages however caused and on any theory of liability arising in any way out of the use of the predictions reported here, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.
